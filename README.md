Today I found out that Codewars does not allow a random user to see your
solutions to a kata. Part of the point of doing them and uploading them was to
show them so I wrote a small program that reads the solutions from the HTML and
writes it to files after formatting them. 

Kind of messy but I put it together in a few hours and it does work, maybe I 
will make this better sometime... but I honestly just want to have it working.
